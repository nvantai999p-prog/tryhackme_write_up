1.What is Hydra? 
Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “haking” tool.
Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service( SSH, Web application form, FTP or SNMP)

2. Hydra Commands
The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service(protocol) we’re attacking.
For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with username being user and a password list being passlist.txt, we’d use the following command:
Hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://machine_IP

SSH protocol
Hydra -l username -P full_path_to_pass machine_IP -t 4 ssh
